              <h3>WHAT MAKES OUR COFFEE SPECIAL?</h3>
                <p>The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about coffee is its advanced quality. The flavors hidden in a cup of coffee are rich and crisp, and this comes not just from the quality of the coffee beans, but from the work ethic and dedication put into it by the farmer.
                <br><br>The beans should then be delivered swiftly to the mill to preserve the freshness and potential of the coffee beans. The beans should then be carefully processed and special attention should be given to ensure that the bean is not dried unevenly, insufficiently, too slowly, or too quickly, as this will reduce its chances of being graded special.
